# ADR 0002 — /v1/ask API Contract

**Status:** Locked from Week 3; extended in Week 4.
**Defended at:** Design Review #1 (Week 5).
**Owners:** Anshu Kumar
**Date:** 2016-09-03

## Context
The cohort needs a stable HTTP surface that downstream consumers (UI, future
agents, evaluation harness, stakeholders running `curl`) can depend on while
the internals of the answer-generation pipeline evolve across W4, W6, W13,
W19, and beyond.

Without a written contract, each week's pipeline change risks silently
breaking a consumer.

## Decision

### Endpoints (locked W3)

- `POST /ask`: request `{"question": "..."}`; response `text/plain` stream.
- `POST /ask_batched`: request `{"question": "..."}`; response `Answer` JSON.
- `GET /health`: response `{"status": "ok"}`.

`question` is a non-empty string. The complete `/ask` response is the
concatenation of its streamed chunks. `/ask_batched` is the non-streaming
endpoint for testing and callers that cannot consume a stream.

### Pydantic shapes (W3, additively extended W4)

```
Question:
  question: str  (min_length=1)

Answer (W3 fields):
  content: str
  cost_usd: float
  retries: int

Answer (W4 additive fields):
  confidence: float = 1.0        # 0.0 to 1.0
  sources: list[str] = []
  schema_version: str = "v1"
```

W4 added the final three fields. The W3 fields are unchanged.
### Error responses

- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: the request fails Pydantic validation; FastAPI
  returns its default `{detail: [...]}` body.
- `5xx`: an upstream LLM provider error exhausts the retry budget; the body is
  JSON in the form `{detail: "..."}`.

### Schema versioning rule (added W4)
Every `Answer` carries a `schema_version` field.

Today's shape is `v1`. It stays `v1` through additive changes: new optional
fields with defaults, new endpoints at different paths, internal model swaps,
prompt edits that do not change the output shape, and retry, logging, or
observability changes.

Breaking changes ship as a new schema version (`v2`, `v3`, and so on): removing
a required field, renaming a public field, changing a field's type, making an
optional field required, semantic changes such as repurposing `cost_usd`, or
changing the error-response shape.

When `v2` ships:

- `/ask` and `/ask_batched` still return `v1` by default.
- `X-Schema-Version: v2`, or `?schema_version=v2`, opts the caller into the new
  shape.
- Both versions are supported in parallel for at least two weeks before `v1`
  is retired.
- The deprecation date is announced in this ADR before removal.

### Cost budget (added W4)

Capstone `/ask_batched` calls should cost no more than **$0.01 each on average**
over a representative batch of 10 questions. This is a soft budget: the intent
is to make an unexpected average-cost increase visible in observability, not to
reject an individual expensive call.

The cohort confirms or refines this number against Lab Step 3 in
`scripts/compare_models.py`.

### Chosen default model (added W4)

The default `Settings.model` is **`gpt-4o-mini`** for the lab. `gpt-4o` remains
available through the same code path for harder questions or when the mini
model's confidence is low.

The latest 21-question comparison found that `gpt-4o-mini` cost $0.000079 per
answer, well below the $0.01 soft budget. It gave usable answers for the short,
factual questions in the comparison, while `gpt-4o` cost about 20.1 times more
per answer. The larger model is therefore reserved for questions where more
careful reasoning or a structured, user-facing explanation adds enough value.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Consumers can rely on `Answer.content`, `Answer.cost_usd`, and
  `Answer.retries` from W3 onward.
- Internal refactors, including W4 tool calling, W6 retrieval, W13 tool use,
  and W19 agents, ship without consumer breakage.
- A clear bump policy means the cohort does not need to renegotiate every
  schema change with downstream consumers.

**Negative**

- Supporting two schema versions in parallel requires the API to branch on the
  requested version for at least two weeks per bump.
- The `cost_usd` budget assumes the cohort reruns the comparison regularly
  enough to catch regressions.

## Notes

- JSON and Pydantic carry the cohort through the rest of the programme.
  Avro/Protobuf would enforce the same versioning discipline with more
  ceremony, so they are not adopted for this cohort.
- The public API contract is distinct from the W2 pipeline's internal
  `Answer.text` field; endpoint handlers translate that field to public
  `Answer.content`.

## Tests securing this contract

- `tests/test_api.py::test_ask_rejects_missing_question`: validation contract.
- `tests/test_api.py::test_health_returns_ok`: `/health` contract.
